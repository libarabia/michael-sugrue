Chapter Two:

 The Institution, the Alumni, the Consequences

The supervisor of education…

is by far the most important of the highest offices in the state.

– Plato, The Laws

Those who received their education at South Carolina College showed a  dogmatic
inclination to reduce politics to a set of ideas or  "principles", which were
often described in quasi-religious terms. Maxcy Gregg (’35), who advocated
reopening the slave trade and later became a Confederate general, wrote James
Henry Hammond (’25): “If I consented  to renounce the right of secession, or
what comes to the same thing, to  declare that it must never be exercised
separately, I should feel that I was abandoning the political faith of my whole
life and turning  Consolidationist.”  Predictably, the alumni tended to be at
the extreme  secessionist proslavery fringe of antebellum political thought.
This is  largely attributable to their education and upbringing, which fostered
the development of a tradition of political discourse that was closely
reasoned, dogmatic and unamenable to compromise. As the antebellum  period wore
on, the gentry closed ranks, adopted almost unanimously a  proslavery political
theory which tended toward secessionist practice.   South Carolina College was
an educational bottleneck through which most  of antebellum South Carolina’s
leading men, like Gregg and Hammond,  passed. It was the last phase in the
process of becoming a gentleman and it imparted to the alumni a unanimity of
opinion and spiritedness of  temperament which they often exhibited in public
life. The College  admitted its first class in 1805 and lost its last class one
afternoon  in 1861 when the entire student body joined the Confederate army en
masse.

​	The requirements for admission to the freshman class were  stringent, at
least in theory. Admission to the sophomore or junior  classes was to be
restricted to those who met the freshman requirements  and also passed an
examination on the first and second year curriculum  as well. The Trustees
required that the prospective freshman be at least fourteen years old and that
he be capable of translating Sallust,  Caesar, Virgil and other Latin texts into
English as well as translating any passage of the Gospel of John from Greek to
English. Prospective  matriculants were also required to know English grammar,
write legibly,  spell correctly, and be familiar with arithmetic.

The importance of family connections in  admissions was acknowledged by many
observers. In the 1850s one member  of the faculty complained in his diary

Faculty examined L Whitner and  T. Gist, the first for sophomore and second for
Junior. – They  were admitted I was certain of this much- The object is to swell
the  catalogue I think we are prepared to admit any person with a name. What a
farce, this examination of applicants. … When will it cease, When will  an
examination mean something?

The College was not a large place. Any graduate would have gotten to know his
fifteen to fifty classmates  intimately and would have become acquainted with
between one hundred and two hundred others who were on campus during his
undergraduate career.  Most matriculants knew personally a large number of the
other men of  roughly their own age, and they often had a relation or friend who
knew  any other given alumnus. In later life, they habitually chose the same
adult occupations: planting, politics, the learned professions. The  students
socialized in the same elite circles and they often married  each others'
sisters and cousins.

​	Whatever their political  views and ambitions, graduates of the College
had references. Even if an alumnus entered law but avoided politics, or if an
alumnus entered  medicine or the clergy, he had connections; he knew important
political  figures by their first name. College connections meant introductions
into elite circles, which might result in an offer to read law in a  prestigious
firm or the opportunity to make a favorable marriage. An  ambitious graduate
could be a legislator a year or two after marrying  and entering the bar.
Professor Francis Lieber wrote in his diary:

​	February 14, Story from real life. I arrived here in October, 1835. In  January 1836, W------- and another student were expelled on account of a duel. Since that time W------ has:-----

​	First. Shot at his antagonist in the streets of Charleston.

​	Second. Studied (?) law with Mr. DeSaussure in Charleston.

​	Third. Married.

​	Fourth. Been admitted to the bar.

​	Fifth. Imprisoned two months for the above shooting.

​	Sixth. Become father of a fine girl.

​	Seventh. Practiced law for some time.

​	Eighth. Elected member of the Legislature.

Now he is only twenty-two years old. What a state of society this requires and must produce!

​	The official records do not identify with certainty of the student to
whom Lieber is referring, but the most likely candidate is W.W. Boyce  (’36?).
In a two page autobiography, Boyce omitted peripheral  information and narrated
his acquisition of the most important tokens of political influence.  He
attended South Carolina College, left without  graduating (he did not mention
expulsion), dueled, married at twenty, at twenty-one was admitted to the bar,
was elected to the legislature, and then to Congress. He was one of the signers
of the Confederate  Constitution and represented South Carolina in the
Confederate Congress. Many prominent politicians, such as Congressman, Governor
and Senator  James Henry Hammond (’25), also took the same paved road to high
office: attendance at the College, a highly publicized duel or two, marriage
into a prominent family, admission to the bar and then election to the  lower
house of the state legislature. From the state legislature, even  higher offices
beckoned in Washington or Montgomery.

​	Alumni of  the College had certain similarities. They were the social
equals of  anyone in the South, and they had influential friends and relatives.
The students generally were drawn from South Carolinian planter families  and
the undergraduates were accordingly a very homogeneous group.  One  professor
described them as "young men of independence or affluence."   While they
deprecated the unseemly scramble for corrupt partisan spoils, and disclaimed any
unworthy ambition for office, their education and  social position demanded that
they be available for public service if  called. Their formidable oratory,
larded with allusions to ancient  history and Latin terms that few could
comprehend, was both persuasive  and entertaining, so the call to office came
often. Many of the alumni  served in the South Carolina legislature, which helps
account for the  generosity of the state's annual funding. Only the University
of  Virginia and South Carolina College among southern colleges got  sustained
and substantial funding in the antebellum period. The military College of South
Carolina, the Citadel, and the sectarian colleges in  the state did not begin to
compete with South Carolina College until the 1850s.

​	William J. Grayson, who graduated in 1809, was  apparently the first
alumnus to be elected to the lower house. He took  his seat in 1813 and
thereafter he was joined by more alumni every year. When Thomas Cooper joined
the faculty in 1820, just before President  Maxcy's death, he noted that "the
College is also a favorite with them  [the legislators] thirty-two members of
the present legislature were  educated there."  The number grew in later years.
Each year the  legislators would attend commencement, and graduates who received
honors and gave impressive speeches could hardly escape comment and  preferment.
After receiving their diplomas, the president of the College personally
introduced each graduate to the luminaries in the first row  of the audience,
and shook hands with these invited guests, who were the most influential men in
the state.  Roughly a third of the legislators  between 1820 and 1860 were
alumni. Most importantly, alumni in the  legislature voted as a block where the
interests of the College were  concerned.

​	The daily regimen which the Trustees prescribed for  the students was as
severe and demanding as that of any of the New  England colleges. The students
were required to rise early, at the sound of a bell "upon whose shrill tongue
many a noisy student has poured  maledictions," as professor Blackburn observed.
They had to dress and  assemble for prayers in chapel at six. The undergraduates
then were to  return to their rooms to study until eight. Breakfast was at
eight, and  the students were then supposed to return to their rooms at nine for
study until twelve, unless summoned by a professor for recitation. The  midday
meal was eaten at one, after which the students were again  expected to study in
their rooms (unless called to recite) until five,  when prayers were again
required in chapel. Supper followed, and then  the students were free until
lights out at nine o'clock.

​	This  harsh regimen was never completely put into practice, and was the
object of much criticism, even from the faculty. In 1807, tutor Edward Hooker,
who had recently graduated from Yale, observed

​	that southern  students require a different management from those of the
northern  colleges, is I believe undoubtedly true. I do not suppose the same
rigid discipline of the north can easily be introduced here, but I have
sometimes thought that it could be extended farther than it is: or at  least
that it might have been once: for it is easier to establish a  rigorous system
at the first than to introduce it by coercion when a  mild one has been
established and become fashionable.

One  professor complained: “We have aped too much the rules of New England
Colleges, by no means suited to our habits and our manners. It were as  easy to
unite the torrid and frigid zones, as to govern, by the same  regimen, the young
lords of slaves, and the sons of industrious New  England farmers.”

​	The regulations produced by the Trustees  required that the students
live on campus and board in commons.   Initially the faculty, even those who
were married and had families,  were required to live in the dormitories with
the undergraduates, a  sanity threatening regulation which was soon dropped.
The faculty  members were instead given separate houses on campus, but they were
still required to investigate all disturbances in the dormitories and to report
for disciplinary action those students who were absent from  their rooms at
night. The College actively tolerated and implicitly  fostered an undisciplined
and violent ethos. As one alumnus recalled,  "colleges depend, for the most
part, on the patronage of the scholars.  The faculties are compelled to choose
between discipline and bread."  It is thus not surprising that the most
effective professors were those  with keenly persuasive rhetorical styles.  It
is even less surprising  that as early as 1813 an investigation by the Trustees
found that  College "discipline had been almost totally relaxed."  Individual
misadventures and general riots by the students by the students  punctuate the
antebellum history of the College. The students developed a well justified
reputation for unruliness. Then as now, education  develops character as well as
intellect.

​	From the outset, the  presidency of the College was a highly coveted and
politically  controversial position. The prestige of being the Palmetto state's
leading intellectual figure coupled with a lucrative salary of $2500 per year
fired the ambitions of many, and threatened the raison d'etre of  an institution
created to cool the heat of partisan wrangling.  In 1805, before the decisive
vote, one Trustee, William D. James, wrote another, Wade Hampton I, to urge the
election of Dr. Daniel McCalla, a  Jeffersonian and a native of South Carolina.
"We must have a Republican  at the head of the College or all is lost," insisted
James; "I'm sure  you think it better to take him than to send to New England
for a man we don't know."  Hampton, who was himself a Jeffersonian, dismissed
Judge  James' suggestion with the coolest of rebuffs, suggesting a rationality
and tolerance impossible a generation later: "I know of no necessary  connection
between party politics and literature."  The Trustees did  choose as the first
President of the College a scholar from New England, Jonathan Maxcy, and they
could hardly have made a better choice.

​	Jonathan Maxcy was a Federalist whose brief but remarkable career was
an almost unbroken series of successes. The son of a Massachusetts  minister, he
entered the College of Rhode Island (now Brown University)  at the age of
fifteen. After graduating first in his class, he took a  position as a tutor at
his college. He was an eloquent speaker, and his  rhetorical gifts combined with
his religious piety prompted the First  Baptist Church of Providence to call him
to be their pastor.  He served  there for less than a year when he was called
back to his alma mater,  this time as president. He was only twenty-four years
old. During the  next ten years Maxcy served both as president and as professor
of  rhetoric. Arriving in Charleston in November, 1804, Maxcy was well
received, and he and his family moved to Columbia and settled on campus  in a
house provided by the College.

​	Maxcy made a very favorable  impression on the Trustees, and he was
elected to the Board as a  replacement for DeSaussure, who had resigned. In the
next month  (January, 1805) the College opened and Maxcy assumed the duties of
president and professor of elocution. "Old Jock," as the undergraduates  called
him behind his back, held this position until his death in June  of 1820.  The
Trustees were less successful in recruiting the remainder  of the faculty. It
may have been that scholars found unattractive the  prospect of living in
Columbia, since the "rambling ill-built village"  had fewer than one thousand
inhabitants and was far removed from what  limited intellectual life America
offered.  A more cosmopolitan city  like Charleston would doubtless have been
more attractive. Columbia had  no remarkable characteristics apart from the fact
that the legislature  met there, and one professor described it as "a place
wholly  unilluminated by science."  Whatever the reasons for the difficulty in
attracting professors, when the College opened its doors for the first  time,
the only members of the faculty were President Maxcy and Enoch  Hanford, who had
accepted the professorship of languages. In the  antebellum period, the College
never had more than six professors.

​	Not only did the Trustees have difficulties obtaining professors, they
had trouble keeping them. Professor Hanford left after only two years,  and
during the fifteen years of Maxcy's administration, from 1805 to  1820, the
College was plagued by constant faculty turnover.  Most of  those who accepted
positions stayed less than five years, which is  noteworthy given the fact that
professors were contractually obligated  to give one year's notice before
resigning. Only a few men stayed on the faculty long enough to exert much of an
influence on the College.  Thomas Park was appointed professor of languages in
1806 and remained  until 1835. Robert Henry accepted the chair of logic and
moral  philosophy in 1818, near the end of the Maxcy administration, and stayed
into the 1840s.  The irascible but perceptive professor of mathematics  and
astronomy, George Blackburn, had his four rancorous years on the  faculty
concluded by a student rebellion. In addition to the full  professors, the
College hired on an ad hoc basis "tutors," who were the  underpaid and
overworked nineteenth century analog of what are known in  today as adjunct
faculty.

​	After the death of Maxcy in 1820, the  Trustees appointed as president
pro tempore the professor of chemistry,  Thomas Cooper.  Cooper had published an
antislavery pamphlet while in  England, and he had supported the protective
tariff while he lived in  the north.  Just before coming to South Carolina,
Cooper had been  politic enough to publish two articles in favor of slavery and
against  the Missouri Compromise.  Of all the professors on the faculty, Cooper
was obviously the man with the greatest intellectual achievements, and  he was
sufficiently flexible to alter his views to suit his new climate. During his
first year the flamboyant expatriate made a good impression  on South Carolina's
educational and political leaders. He held his  tongue, shunned controversy, and
spread on the campus a peacock's tail  of knowledge which won the admiration of
all. The next year, the  Trustees voted him permanently to the presidency, a
position he held  until 1833 when he had sparked such a firestorm of political
and  religious conflict that he was hounded from office after an  investigation
by the state legislature into the decline of the College.

​	When he was ousted from the presidency in 1834, Cooper said "The
fanatics have succeeded at last," and this was perhaps more penetrating  than
even he understood.  There was no shortage of fanaticism in South  Carolina in
the 1820s and 1830s, and many of Cooper's enemies were  indeed fanatics, but so
were most of Cooper's supporters and, most  importantly, so was Cooper.  Thomas
Cooper operated on the  self-indulgent assumption that religious fanaticism was
a vice but  secular fanaticism a virtue, a virtue he shared with many
contemporary  South Carolinian politicians and with his own boisterous students.

​	Cooper had little sense of proportion, and his political and religious
views were excessively zealous. For Cooper, politics was a kind of  ersatz
religion, while religion, he insisted, was politics with a  dangerous veneer of
superstition.  His vituperative rhetoric,  particularly on the topic of his
political religion, was very  influential among the students, and it is not
surprising that later on,  they, like Cooper, were noted for their conflation of
politics and  religion. One alumnus remarked of these students

​	Nothing could be more strikingly significant, of the unrestricted
dominance which the  principle of state sovereignty held over the men who had
been educated  at South Carolina College than their heroic conduct shown on the
fields  of carnage, from the commencement to the end of the War between the
States.... It was not a mere theory or policy -- it was a creed, a  religion.
This creed, this political religion of the South, was  exemplified in blood on
every battlefield.

​	Thomas Cooper’s  intellectual achievements were exceptional. He studied
law, medicine,  philosophy, chemistry, languages, and literature, among other
subjects.  One who knew him reported that "there was nothing in law, physic,
divinity, chemistry, or general science that he entirely overlooked."   Quick
witted and sharp tongued, Cooper had a particular taste for  politics, and an
exceptional talent for getting himself into trouble.  One of his former students
noted: "He loved excitement, and would  participate in it wherever it was to be
found. He was a partizan [sic]  with more than usual bitterness."  Cooper was
stubbornly self righteous, and for him, indignation was more of a hobby than an
emotion. "He had  already reached conclusions on every possible question of
politics,  morals and religion. No man was more tenacious, dogmatic, or had a
bolder and more uncompromising spirit."

​	Thomas Jefferson  respected Cooper's intellectual abilities (and his
vitriolic pen) but  was unsuccessful in obtaining a professorship for him at the
new  University of Virginia.  Cooper’s altered views on slavery and tariffs
states rights made him comfortable with South Carolina’s politicians,  but his
inflexibility impeded his relations to his own students. Cooper  never blamed
himself when he could hold others responsible. Writing to  Jefferson, Cooper
suggested that it was the upbringing of his  undergraduates that made them
intractable when they came to College.

​	Dr. Dwight prophesyed [sic] that no collegiate institution could be
permanent south of the Potowmack [sic]. In my own opinion the parental
indulgence of the South, renders young men less fit for College  government than
the habits of the northern people; and the rigid  discipline of the northern
seminaries must be put in force inexorably in the South, or the people who are
sent for instruction will permit their teachers to give it to them, only when
the student condescends to be  taught.

According to Cooper, the situation of professors at South Carolina College was
unenviable because "authority [was] disputed inch  by inch and their lives put
in jeopardy if they resist the encroachments of a set of hot headed boys, whom
no kindness can conciliate...."

​	Cooper often expressed his disdain for rhetoric, yet he was an
exceptionally persuasive speaker, and no one could attend his lectures  and not
be influenced.  According to one of his students, "the secret of his success is
easily told. Never was there a better lecturer, a finer  teacher."  Cooper had
the mind of a skeptic but the heart of a true  believer. Perhaps "true
disbeliever" would be a better way of describing him. Once safely ensconced in
the president's chair he discarded his  pose of moderation and repeatedly
attacked religion, Christianity, and  the clergy, in person and in print,
without provocation and without  restraint. The tendentious content and
gratuitously hectoring tone of  his criticism are typical of his notorious
"infidelity":

​	To say  that any member of society is not of the productive class does
not imply that we have not been prodigal in recompensing by salaries or by
reputation, classes of an unproductive character, greatly to the  detriment of
public morals, of public wealth, and of public expedience.  Some one has
observed that mankind pay best 1st. those who murder and  destroy them; warriors
and heroes. 2nd. those who cheat them; statesmen  and the priesthood; 3rd. those
who amuse them; singers, actors, dancers, fidlers, [sic] etc. 4th. those who
instruct them.... The priesthood, a  class of men who cost us at this moment
between 12 to 14,000,000 of  dollars annually have contrived to persuade us that
they are absolutely  necessary to our welfare. I know not in what respect.

​	Once in  South Carolina, Cooper repudiated his earlier admiration for
the French  Revolution at least insofar as it was a threat to slavery, but he
held  fast to Robespierre's aggressive anticlericalism, which he formulated in
the language of English political economy. On his deathbed, in the  tradition of
David Hume and Thomas Paine, Cooper wrote a defiant letter  which he left in the
keeping of his physician Dr. M. H. Deleon. In this  final testament to his
infidelity, he unequivocally stated that he knew  he was dying, that he remained
a religious skeptic, and that he wished  to prevent the "orthodox" from being
gulled into believing that he made a deathbed conversion.  It is easy enough to
see why many pious citizens  held that "Dr. Cooper is a poor, wicked, miserable
old creature, and  deservedly unpopular."

​	 One former student wrote of Cooper that  "he read the Bible, whose
authority he openly denied, and prayed to a  God in whom he did not believe,
with less reverence than he would  discuss the theory of phlogiston or the
igneous formation of the earth."  Another wrote that Cooper was "a pronounced
infidel."  In print,  Cooper had denied, among other things, the existence of
the soul,  freedom of the will, eternal damnation, and the Trinity.  Annually,
roughly six to eight weeks before graduation, Cooper used to give to the senior
class a lecture called "The Authenticity of the Pentateuch" in  which he
subjected the "bible" and by implication "christianity" (Cooper always insisted
on the lower case "b" and "c") to withering historical  criticism. One who heard
this tirade recalled:

​	There was no  necessity for his delivering this lecture. It did not
belong to his  chair of political economy. Nor was it necessary as president. I
have  always wondered why the Trustees of the College permitted him to go out
of the routine of his duties to give a lecture of this sort to a set of  young
men just starting out in the world. I am amazed at this late day  that a country
so full of Presbyterianism and bigotry as that was at the time should have
tolerated a man in his position.... Dr. Cooper lived  before his day. If he had
flourished now, in the days of Darwin, Tyndall and Huxley, he would have been a
greater infidel than all three of them put together.

​	Despite his irreligious views, Cooper was  personally abstemious, a
secular Puritan, The personal lives of other  faculty members did not always set
as good an example for their students as Cooper's. Both of the College tutors
were dismissed in 1827 for  chronic drunkenness, and the students' recitations
were doubtless  impeded by their tutors' ringing hangovers.  In the wake of
Cooper's  dismissal, the Trustees asked prominent gentlemen for an evaluation of
the College and faculty. One state legislator, Joseph Woodward, told the
Trustees that "the private habits of a certain professor (you know  whom) and
his vulgar associations are also a matter of objection to the  College."

​	It is not entirely clear to which professor Woodward  was referring.
Professor Wallace kept a slave mistress in the town of  Columbia and started a
family with her. The reference might also be to  Professor Nott, the high living
bachelor.  It is clear that whatever  Wallace or Nott (or someone else) was
notorious for, these indiscretions were not a secret. In 1834, Columbia was a
small town of less than  4,000 people, and then as now, gossip, especially
choice gossip about  what professors do besides think, circulated very freely.
Mr. Woodward  in the legislature knew, he pointedly assumed that the Trustees
knew,  and it is a sure thing that the undergraduates knew.

​	Cooper’s  attention was rarely distracted by liquor or sex, political
agitation  was his primary interest. He had written polemical political tracts
most of his adult life. Cooper had enthusiastically adopted the  laissez-faire
political economy of Smith and Ricardo, which he combined  with the reductive,
atheistic naturalism of the French Enlightenment. He was more than eager to
share his knowledge and opinions with his  students, and not just with them. In
1823, he published an open letter  to South Carolina's congressional delegation
against the tariff, which  was widely reprinted on account of its caustic
cogency.  This pamphlet  caused a sensation within the state and in Washington.
Cooper's biting  prose and weighty erudition made him a formidable opponent. As
one  contemporary remembered, "He was an exceedingly hard old nut for any man to
deal with in matters of political economy."  Nationalism, economic  and
otherwise, went into an eclipse in South Carolinian political  circles, and
Thomas Cooper's propaganda cast a lengthening shadow.  Cooper’s political
writings were so influential that his unusual  religious views were at least
tolerated by a large segment of the South  Carolina’s political elite. This odd
state of affairs generated an ad  hoc coalition between the Unionist minority
and dissatisfied communities of religious believers. This unlikely pairing
worked to oust Cooper and thus indirectly stymied the implementation of
secessionist political  doctrines during the tariff crisis of the 1820s and
1830s.

​	  Political agitation was attractive to Cooper's vanity, and as his work
on the tariff was well received, he began to churn out polemical  political
pamphlets at a remarkable rate. He displayed an  eighteenth-century gentleman's
contempt for political parties and the  self-interested careerism that attended
them. He made his views quite  clear in 1824 when he published Consolidation.
In this pamphlet Cooper  railed against corruption, party spirit, and
usurpation, which he  identified with Clay's nationalism and the American
system. The proper  alternative, according to Cooper, was a government of
independent  gentlemen above faction, who respected the  Constitutional
safeguards  for property, slavery and states rights. Cooper intended this essay
to  provide his allies with campaign arguments in the election of 1824, and
although his preferred candidate, Crawford, was not elected, this piece  was
nonetheless influential because many of the constitutional and  economic
arguments made by southern sectionalists in the 1830s were  first developed
here.

​	Cooper wrote his next tract, On the  Constitution, in 1826.  Cooper
insisted that the Constitution was a  federative compact between sovereign
states which retained the option of withdrawing at any time. Cooper was equally
certain of his views on  representation, which had much in common with the views
of his old foe,  Edmund Burke. Cooper imperatively stated: "You are sent to the
national  council to deliberate for the nation, not for the petty district in
which you reside." Each representative, he insisted, was a virtual
representative: "every man called to the national legislature is a  national and
not a local representative...."  This idea was thoroughly  absorbed by Cooper's
undergraduates. By the late 1820s Cooper had become a leading figure in the
Nullification crisis, and the proslavery,  antitariff, free trade, ultra
states-rights lectures so popular among  the undergraduates were ready for
publication. Lectures on the Elements  of Political Economy was the result.
This pioneering work had the same  inflammatory tone and polemical intent as his
other works. In addition  to popularizing topics in laissez faire economics,
these lectures treat  the protective tariff as an elaborate swindle employed by
a cabal of  rapacious spoilsmen, who, as it turned out, lived north of the
Potomac.  Similar sentiments were also expressed in Cooper's final work in the
dismal science, A Manual of Political Economy.

​	Cooper often  waxed eloquent about things that enraged him, and as he
was enraged  often, he was eloquent much of the time. He became nationally
prominent  as an instigator of disunion for an infamous 1827 speech in which he
stated:

​	I have said that we shall, erelong, be compelled to  calculate the value
of our Union; and to inquire of what use is this  most unequal alliance by which
the South has always been the loser and  the North always the gainer? Is it
worth our while to continue the union of States where the North demand to be our
masters and we are required  to be their tributaries? Who, with the most
insulting mockery, call the  yoke they have put upon us the American system! The
question, however,  is fast approaching to the alternative, submission or
separation.

This speech was the most influential Cooper ever made. It is an invitation  to
the Civil War, and like so much of Cooper's work, it was demagogy for
patricians; he was a rabble rouser to the rich and famous.  More  intrepid than
original, Cooper was resurrecting the specter of disunion, which had been
interred since 1790, when Senator Smith of South  Carolina had successfully
tabled the Quakers' abolition petitions.  Cooper was the first prominent
official of his generation to publicly  articulate the logical conclusion of the
sectional controversies that  made such great demands on his time and his
inkwell.  It is worth noting that when this speech was made “nullification” was
not yet at issue,  Cooper was a radical proslavery, antitariff secessionist from
a very  early date.

​	Cooper was at the vanguard of Southern nationalism and he was
self-consciously trying to precipitate secession. He wrote  in 1829:

​	My own opinion is, that if the tariff of protection be  not repealed,
South Carolina and Georgia will secede from the Union  toward the close of 1830.
Believing that they ought to do so, both on  principle and from experience, I
shall promote the secession (if the  tariff continues to be a tariff of monopoly
protection) to the utmost of my powers....

​	Unlike his anti-religious jeremiads, Cooper's  political agitation
reinforced rather than jeopardized his position in  the College and the state
because most of the Trustees, who were among  the most influential politicians
in the state, were themselves ardent  ultra southern extremists. During the
Nullification Convention of 1832,  which was held in Columbia down the street
from the College, nine of the most prominent participants were Trustees, and
seven of these were  College alumni.  Most of Cooper's former students were too
young to  exert much influence on either side of the Nullification issue, but a
handful of graduates from the first years of Cooper's tenure were at the
Convention.  Many young alumni were supporters. As Calhoun noted with  approval,
“¾ of the young men of talents are with us.”

​	One  contemporary referred to Cooper as "the father of Nullification."
This  is something of an exaggeration, because Cooper was an anti tariff
secessionist who came to Nullification as an afterthought. Nonetheless,  many of
the addresses given by the Nullifiers borrowed heavily from  Cooper's polemical
writings. In 1830, on the floor of Congress George  McDuffie (‘13) echoed the
polemics of Cooper when he stated “I venture  the assertion, that no priesthood,
in the darkest ages of ignorance and  superstition, ever pursued their selfish
objects with more untiring  perseverance and consummate art than the
manufacturing capitalists have  prosecuted their mercenary schemes of monopoly.
Cooper's accusations  against his religious and political foes got wilder and
more  irresponsible as time wore on. In 1828, he wrote to David McCord (’14) a
personal friend and editor of the pro-Nullification Columbia Southern
Telescope: "All the tariff men rely on exciting a revolt among our  slaves."
The same factual foundation and emotional equilibrium is found in his published
remarks on the clergy. "Who ordained the Sabbath?  Those avaricious, ambitious,
fraudulent and impudent impostors, the  Christian priests. For what purpose? To
create business for themselves;  to obtain influence; to get money; to make
their services necessary to  the ignorant...."

​	Perhaps Cooper merely underestimated the  influence of those who howled
for his removal. Certainly he was not the  only secessionist and religious
skeptic in town, and the connection  between religious enthusiasm and radical
politics was a new element in  lowcountry politics.  As one irate upcountryman
noted,  "... there is in Columbia a class of exclusives, a set of men who belong
to no church,  who regard themselves as the aristocracy of the town, and who, if
things have not materially changed since we lived there, exert a most
pernicious influence on the minds of the students in the College."  The
gentlemen who dominated the legislature were not generally noted for  their
religiosity, and many of them expressed admiration for Cooper's  political
views.

​	All who met Cooper were impressed by his  political and religious
opinions, regardless of whether they found his  views praiseworthy or depraved.
In 1834, George Featherstonaugh, an  English traveler, spent some time in
Columbia with Cooper, just before  Cooper and his entire faculty were forced to
resign. His encounter with  Cooper and his cronies was particularly revealing.
Featherstonaugh  reported that Cooper greatly regretted the fact that South
Carolina had  not made war on the United States over the tariff. The English
traveler  had naively congratulated Cooper that the issue had been compromised.
Cooper

​	rose from his easy chair, and although bent double like a  hook, he
seized the hearth brush, with eyes full of fire, and wielding  the brush as if
it were a broadsword denounced the Compromise Act as an  ignoble measure he
could never approve of; declared the Nullifiers were  quite in the wrong to make
peace with the Union men (their opponents in  South Carolina) and that it would
have been a much better course for  them to have taken the field against General
Jackson and fought all the  power he could have brought against them. "We have
lost a fine  opportunity sir, of carrying this state into the highest renown,"
said  this crooked little octogenarian; and then giving General Jackson a
desperate cut with the hearth-brush, he went back to his easy chair  again.

Cooper's intellectual influence was far more dangerous  than his hearthbrush and
his visionary military and political judgements were in strange contrast to his
extreme religious skepticism, which was simultaneously dogmatic and quixotic. It
is not especially surprising  that although the Englishman thought highly of
Cooper's learning, he  also came away with the feeling that "…some of his screws
were  uncommonly loose, particularly his religious ones..."

​	 Featherstonaugh got a chance to dine and converse with the professors
and several of Cooper's friends at a dinner party in Columbia.

​	 Our party consisted of some gentlemen of the place, Dr. Cooper, and a
few professors belonging to the College. Some of them were very  intelligent men
and hearty in their manners. What particularly struck me at this dinner was the
total want of caution and reserve in the ultra  opinions they expressed about
religion and politics; on these topics  their conversation was not at all
addressed to me, but seemed to be a  resumption of opinions they were accustomed
to express whenever they  met, and upon all occasions. A stranger dropped in
amongst them from the clouds would hardly have supposed himself amongst
Americans, the  language that they used and the opinions they expressed were so
diametrically opposed to the self laudatory strain they too generally  indulge
in when speaking of their country or themselves. It was quite  new to me to hear
men of the better class express themselves openly  against a republican
government, and to listen to discussions of great  ability the object of which
was to show that there can never be a good  government if it is not administered
by gentlemen.

​	These men  held the view that Madison was a demagogue, "one of the worst
men the  Country had produced" and that the virtue necessary to a good
government was not to be found in the corruption and spoilsmanship of American
political life.  The faculty and Cooper's intimate friends (who were  almost
certainly state legislators, and perhaps alumni of the College as well) had
arrived at a consensus that was a peculiar litany of  anti-national sentiments.

​	...(S)omething very extravagant having  been said, I asked them if they
called themselves Americans yet; the  gentleman who had interrupted me before
[to express disapproval of  Madison] said, "If you ask me if I am an American,
my answer is No, sir, I am a South Carolinian." If the children of these
Nullifiers are  brought up in the same opinions, which they are very likely to
be, here  are fine elements for future disunion; for imbibing from their infancy
the notion that they are born to command, it will be intolerable for  them to
submit to be, in their own estimation, the drudges of Northern  manufacturers,
whom they despise as an inferior race of men. Even now  there is nothing a
southern man resents so much as being called a  Yankee....

​	One of the gentlemen who had been at the dinner party met
Featherstonaugh the next day. The Englishman had tactfully waited  until he was
about to leave Columbia before he ventured delicately to  ask this unnamed
gentleman about slavery.

​	The line of argument he took up in answer to my observation was really
very curious, and  deserves to be recorded. He observed that the institution of
slavery (so he dignified this bondage) was not understood outside of the
southern  states; that it elevated the character of the master, by comparison,
made him jealous of his own, and the natural friend of public liberty;  that the
dignity of character which had belonged to southern gentlemen  from Washington
down to the present times was unknown to men of the  northern states.... [The
North lacked slavery], and everybody knew that  this generated a rapacious
spirit, and made the accumulation of wealth  the object of every man's life.
This was not the case in South Carolina, where the planter, whatever might be
his transactions, was careful not  to encroach upon the character of a gentleman
[he gave Calhoun as an  example of a gentleman politician].... All these great
principles of  action, he said were developed and strengthened by the
institution of  slavery; that the slaves were not an unhappy race of men.... If
there  had been a necessity for it in the late dispute with the United States
government the slaves would have shown to a man their well known  fidelity to
their masters.

​	This gentleman was obviously a  practiced speaker, and it is also
obvious that his proslavery oration  was not an improvisation. It is equally
clear that the English visitor  had hit a nerve with even the most tentative
inquiry about the justice  of slavery. Blown back by this gentleman's verbal
hurricane,  Featherstonaugh made no retort, but he was silently appalled by the
content of the argument. He noted:

​	I was struck with this  justification of slavery, which, notwithstanding
its excluding humanity, benevolence, and justice from the list of our duties to
others would  seem to qualify white men in a very high degree for the enjoyment
of the compulsory labor of men of a different color. If it means anything it
must mean that every man should be a slaveholder in order to [sic,  foster?] the
successful development of his own inherent dignity.

Whether this gentleman was a legislator or a professor, he was a rabidly
proslavery, ultrasectionalist orator, who was extremely sensitive about
questions of honor.

​	For most of his tenure at the College,  Cooper devoted himself to
politics and was a weak disciplinarian. This  is perhaps why one critic
complained, "The principal objection to the  faculty is that they have been
engaged too much in politics to the  neglect of their duties."  When Cooper was
investigated by the  legislature in 1833 on grounds of religious infidelity and
mismanagement of the College, few would testify against Cooper, and the charges
against him were so diffuse that he was in little legal jeopardy.  The  students
who remained in the College sided with him, and it was rumored  that they would
leave en masse if he was dismissed.

​	The Board  of Trustees, which was dominated by his extremist cronies,
dismissed all charges.  Indignant, Cooper's opponents redoubled their efforts
against him. As one newspaper put it, the acquittal of Cooper gave him free
rein to instill "treason and infidelity into the heads and hearts of the youth
of South Carolina."  The disgusted enemies of Cooper brought down upon the
College overwhelming opprobrium, and despite the fact that the verdict went his
way, Cooper's College was likely to lose the few  students who remained. Cooper
could no longer retain his office. The  seventy-five year old Cooper resigned
the presidency on November 27,  1833, but stayed on as professor of chemistry.
This gesture proved  insufficient. Many students were withdrawn by their
parents, few  entered, and enrollment dropped to a total of forty by late 1834.
Along  with all the other members of the faculty, the heresiarch of
Nullification severed his connection with the College on December 9,  1834.

​	Under these very difficult circumstances, a special  committee of
Trustees, composed of the Governor (McDuffie) and two  former Governors (Hayne
and Hamilton), worked feverishly to put together a faculty that would be
prepared to meet students in the Fall of 1835.  They wrote letters, made
inquiries, and solicited recommendations. By  June, they had more than thirty
candidates, and the full Board set to  work selecting professors who could
regain public confidence. The most  politically astute decision the Trustees
reached was the establishment  of a new professorship of "Evidences of
Christianity and Sacred  Literature," which was offered to Rev. William Capers
(‘06), an alumnus  who was a Methodist clergyman.  While this concession to
religion must  have made Cooper and his fellow infidels wince, the decision to
have a  minister on the faculty who would insure religious orthodoxy helped
reconcile hostile religious believers to the College. The most brilliant
addition to the faculty was Francis Lieber, an expatriate German who  had earned
an international reputation for scholarship. He had published several books,
edited the Encyclopedia Americana, and was admirably  equipped to take the
professorship in history and political economy.

​	 The critics of the College were still not satisfied.  Professor Nott
(‘14) had been kept on as the professor of Belles Lettres, and his  religious
skepticism was notorious. The new professors were accused of  being Yankees and
enemies of religion. As one writer remarked, "we had  better send our boys to
Harvard or Yale, where they shall become  thoroughly versed in Yankee
speculations" rather than put them in the  hands of impious northerners in their
own midst.  Particular xenophobia  was reserved for Lieber, who, like Cooper,
was a suspiciously learned  foreigner who had been exposed to radical ideas.
Sectarians, both  religious and political, were alarmed by the possibility that
Lieber  might not share their prejudices. Faced with the prospect of being
denied the professorship he and his family desperately needed, the  impoverished
Lieber wrote a carefully worded letter to the Columbia  Telescope in which he
denied that he was either an atheist and or an  abolitionist, as had been
claimed by his opponents.

​	Threatened  by the prospect of the public's rejection of the new
faculty, the  Trustees counterattacked aggressively in newspapers and pamphlets.
Five  of the most prominent Trustees published a pamphlet, An Appeal on Behalf
of South Carolina College, which attempted to reassure the public about the
political and religious orthodoxy of the new faculty. The Trustees  denied that
they favored infidel Yankees: "It is unjust to suppose that  the Trustees of the
South Carolina College -- many of them graduates of  that institution,- all
Southern men -- Carolinians, not only in name but in heart, could have been
actuated by so unworthy a spirit."  The  pamphlet went on to give a brief
biography of each professor, including  testimony from influential men regarding
the intellectual aptitude,  religiosity, and politically inoffensive beliefs of
the new faculty. The concerted efforts of the Trustees quieted most of the
opposition, and  classes resumed without difficulty in the Fall. Although

Rev.  William Capers (‘06) declined the professorship of "Evidences of
Christianity," it was accepted by Rev. Stephen Elliott (‘25), an  Episcopal
minister, who was highly regarded by the devout.

​	The  final task confronting the Trustees was the selection of a
president. A  consensus candidate emerged that satisfied all concerned. Robert
Woodward Barnwell was appointed president, and he proved to be an  excellent
choice. Barnwell was a native South Carolinian whose family  had been
politically prominent since colonial times. He had been the  valedictorian of
his class at Harvard, and his classmates, who included  among other luminaries
Ralph Waldo Emerson, recognized his exceptional  brilliance.  Barnwell was too
gracious to apply for the presidency of  the College; in the best Federalist
style, he accepted the unsolicited  call to public service as an obligation
entailed by his position in  society. Soon after his arrival on campus he was
elected to the Board of Trustees, a mark of respect never accorded Cooper.

​	Barnwell's  career was spectacular. The characteristic qualities of the
most highly  regarded South Carolinian gentlemen were all to be found in
Barnwell. He was a pious Episcopalian, a large slaveholder, and an outstanding
lawyer. Soon after his admission to the bar he was elected to the state
legislature, thereafter he was elected twice to Congress. He was a  member of
the Nullification Convention, and he signed the ordinance, yet he was widely
respected by politicians of all persuasions. He  eventually became a US Senator
and a member of South Carolina’s  Secession Convention. He signed the
Confederate Constitution and  represented South Carolina in the Confederate
senate. Confidence in  Barnwell ran high; when the Confederate cabinet was being
formed in  1861, Jefferson Davis offered him the position of Secretary of State,
a  position he declined.  After the Civil War when the College was revived  as a
university, Barnwell became the president once again.

​	 Barnwell's first tenure as president, from 1836 to 1841, restored the
College to a flourishing condition. Throughout the state, the press was  nearly
unanimous in its approval, and the legislature showed their  support by
increasing the funds for the College.  Popular support was  indicated by the
increased number of students who flooded into Columbia. Despite the fact that
the tuition was increased, families from across  the state, and from other
Southern states as well, began sending their  sons to the College in
unprecedented numbers. From the handful of  students left on at the end of
Cooper's presidency, enrollment shot up  in 1836, and again in 1837, and it
continued to increase dramatically.

​	Barnwell resigned on account of ill health in 1841 and there was no
candidate for the presidency who could bring to the position his  superior
qualifications. The Trustees appointed Professor Robert Henry  president pro
tempore, with alumnus Maximilian Laborde (’21) assuming  his professorship.
Henry, who had been a professor under Cooper, had  rejoined the faculty in 1839
as professor of moral philosophy and logic. Henry was competent, but not
charismatic or popular; compared to  Barnwell, he was a plowhorse rather than a
thoroughbred. When the  Trustees confirmed him as president in 1842, confidence
in the College  slipped and enrollment dropped. One newspaper noted, "no one has
anything criminal to charge upon him -- only that he will not do for
president."  After a brief inquiry, the Board removed Henry quietly in  1845,
but he was kept on as professor of Greek until his death in 1856.

​	The next president of the College, former Senator William Campbell
Preston (‘12), was the first alumnus to be elected to that honor. Like
Barnwell, Preston was a widely respected figure whose six years in  office (from
1845 to 1851) lent stability, decorum, and favorable  publicity to the College.
Preston had studied in Europe after his  graduation, and when he returned home,
he was elected to the state  legislature. He had begun his political career as a
Nullifier, and was  elected to Congress, but he never allowed himself to be
distracted by  constitutional casuistry. He insisted that "The slave question
will be  the real issue - All others will be absorbed in it."  Unlike most
Nullifiers, he eschewed what he viewed as the vulgarity of the  Democrats; once
in Washington he moved towards conservative Whiggery.  His intelligence,
probity, and eloquence helped him advance politically, but he ran afoul of
Calhoun and consequently lost his Senate seat.  Preston was so acclaimed as a
public speaker in a political culture that could boast of many effective
orators, that a neologism, "Prestonian,"  meaning exceptionally eloquent, crept
into use.  His unusual forensic  capacities were of great service to him in
controlling the students, who were otherwise difficult to restrain. Preston's
reputation helped the  fortunes of the College immensely and bolstered its
prestige throughout  the state. During his tenure enrollment increased to
unprecedented  levels, and in 1849, when the high point of 237 students was
reached,  the physical capacities of the College were taxed nearly beyond their
limit.

​	The next president of the College, James Henly  Thornwell (’31),
exercised more influence on the College than any other  figure in its history
with the possible exception of Thomas Cooper.  Thornwell (’31) was a brilliant
scholar, an outstanding public speaker,  and a religious zealot. One
contemporary noted of Thornwell, “There is a good deal of feeling against him on
the ground that he is an intolerant zealot…self confidence and dogmatism are…his
besetting sins.”  He had  been the valedictorian of the class of 1831, and he
was appointed to his professorship at the age of twenty-five. Sometime after
graduation,  Thornwell had a conversion experience; he immediately joined the
Presbyterian church and began studying for the ministry. Presbyterianism gave
Thornwell a combustible vocabulary with which to stoke the furnace of his
formidable oratory. Francis Lieber, his colleague on the  faculty, aptly
described Thornwell as "a nineteenth century Jonathan  Edwards."

​	One of his admirers, a fellow faculty member, noted  "He luxuriated in
the profound, and dwelt with delight upon subjects  which, by the many, are
regarded as incomprehensible."  Slavery,  according to Thornwell was sanctioned
by the Bible. Notes from one of  Thornwell’s lectures  on slavery given in 1855
and suggest a standard  Biblical defense which rejected polygenesis.  Scientific
racists who  attempted to prove that blacks and whites were of different species
were, like abolitionists, atheists bent on consigning mankind to eternal
damnation. Thornwell saw  the looming political crisis in apocalyptic  terms:

​	The parties to this conflict are not merely abolitionists and
slaveholders -- they are atheists, socialists, communists, red  republicans,
Jacobins on the one side, and the friends of order and  regulated freedom on the
other. In one word, the world is the battle  ground -- Christianity and atheism
the combatants; and the progress of  humanity the stake.

Like Cooper, Thornwell had no sense of  proportion, but unlike Cooper,
Thornwell's dogmas were religious rather  than secular. Professor Lieber once
made the mistake of attending one of Thornwell's "furibund" sermons, the content
of which was a "bitter,  biting, acrid, scratching, tearing, grating, grinding,
harrowing,  infaming, Hyper-Calvinism."  One of Thornwell's admirers
enthusiastically told Lieber that there had been no man like Thornwell  since
Calvin himself. Lieber replied, "I hope so."

​	From the time of his appointment in 1838 until his death in 1862,
Thornwell wielded  more influence on campus than anyone else. He was unhappy in
his  original position as professor of Belles Lettres. Scarcely two years  after
joining the faculty, he tendered his resignation, informing the  Trustees that
he felt obliged to pursue religious concerns.  The  Trustees, anxious to keep
the charismatic professor, worked out an  agreement that allowed him to remain
on the faculty while also serving  as pastor of the local Presbyterian church.
Still, Thornwell was unhappy because he wished to attend to his religious duties
full time. In 1840, when Stephen Elliott resigned the professorship of Sacred
Literature  and Evidences of Christianity, Thornwell was offered and gladly
accepted the position. Still, oppressed by the burden of Calvinistic guilt,
Thornwell continued to be torn between his religious and his academic
responsibilities. In the late 1840s when Thornwell was again considering
resignation, President Preston wrote to Thornwell's fellow churchmen  asking
them to keep Thornwell on the faculty:

​	We cannot afford to lose Dr. Thornwell from the College. In the first
place, he is the  representative of the Presbyterian Church, which embraces the
bone and  sinew of the state, without whose support, the institution cannot
exist. In the second place, he has acquired that moral influence over the
students, which is superior even to the law; and his removal will take  away the
very buttresses on which the administration of the College  rests.

​	Thornwell left the presidency in 1855 to devote himself  to his
religious obligations. The natural successor to Thornwell was  Francis Lieber.
He had been on the faculty for twenty years, he had the  respect of the students
and he was one of the most learned men in  America.  Lieber wanted the post
badly, and he had been angling for it  at least since 1845.  Although Thornwell
was no longer on the faculty,  he continued on as a Trustee. Thornwell neither
liked nor trusted  Lieber, whose religious moderation he despised and whose
intellectual  reputation he disparaged.  He brought his considerable influence
to bear against Lieber, and the College suffered as a result.  Thornwell's
Calvinistic intolerance allowed him to thwart Lieber's aspirations out  of moral
duty. Other politicians, led by Governor James H. Adams (who  was notorious as
an advocate for the re-opening of the slave trade)  opposed Lieber because they
were suspicious of his political views.   Many held the plausible belief that
Lieber lacked sympathy with their  secessionist proslavery leanings, and some
charged that he was a covert  abolitionist.  This coalition of militant
religious believers and  extreme secessionists proved an insurmountable barrier
to the German  expatriate. By 1855, secessionist politicians had shrugged off
the  incubus of religious opposition which had impeded Southern nationalists
like Cooper during the Nullification Crisis.

​	With regard to  Southern culture, Lieber held views similar to those
held later by H. L. Mencken, but he was tactful enough to keep his opinions
quiet.  He  wrote to one of his European friends, "I live at the South it is
true,  but with respect to culture and intellectual life ... I might as well be
in Siberia."  Even though Lieber gave no overt indication of his  heterodox
views, “... [P]eople have found out instinctively that I am  not one of them.
Nothing positive has happened, no offence given....  [N]othing could make me
more one of them, and give me greater renown,  than a pamphlet written for the
South, especially in favor of slavery. I would sooner cut off my right hand!”

​	Because his political and  religious opinions (which in the context of
nineteenth century American  intellectual culture were reasonably tolerant and
moderate) could not be expressed within the rigid intellectual orthodoxy of
South Carolina  College, he retired to his study and became an indefatigable
writer of  books, essays, and letters.  Although Lieber wrote numerous letters
to  faraway correspondents, he also corresponded with the president of the
College, William Campbell Preston (‘12), who lived next door to him on  campus.
In 1850 he had a brief discussion in the faculty room with  Preston on the "all
engrossing topic of Union or no Union," but mindful  of the fact that expressing
unpopular opinions might jeopardize his  career, he reserved his views for the
more private medium of a letter.   Professor Matthew expressed similar
impatience with the constraints on  free discussion he encountered on campus. By
mid-century, “political  correctness” of a reactionary proslavery, secessionist
variety had  descended upon the College and professors knew they dare not voice
unpopular views.

​	Despite the increasingly truncated domain of  political views which
could be advocated on campus, in the classroom  Lieber was an exceptionally fine
lecturer. He never adopted the  practice, common among the other professors, of
annually giving the same lectures, from the same notes. He wrote in 1857, "I
have never in my  life delivered the same lecture twice over."  Lieber taught
what  Nietzsche later called "monumental history".  While his lectures were
ostensibly on the political life of the West from the ancients to the  present,
in practice they were stories of the courage, patriotism, and  virtue that had
been displayed by the heroic figures of the past. To  complete the effect, his
classroom was decorated with the busts of the  figures he admired most.
Socrates, Cicero, Milton, Kant, Goethe, Luther, Washington, Alexander Hamilton,
William Penn, among others, looked down in silent reproach on the awed students.
Lieber felt constrained and  out of place in the rigid proslavery orthodoxy
which permeated the  College. In 1850 he wrote to Calhoun,

​	It is not the North that is against you. It is mankind, it is the world,
it is civilization, it is  history, it is reason, it is God that is against
slavery.... If you fear discussion, if you maintain that the South cannot afford
it, that every man who differs from your community, or who sees the deficiencies
in  the institution must be hushed, then you admit at the same time that the
whole institution is to be kept up by violence only and is against the  spirit
of the times and unameliorable, which means in other words, that  violence
supports it and violence will be its end.

​	Despite his  heavy accent, Lieber was a fine speaker, and the thoughts
expressed in  his lectures, such as "The state does not make right, but is
founded  upon it," were greatly admired but perhaps not fully appreciated by his
undergraduates.  One of his students recalled that "He was the most  painstaking
and efficient teacher I have ever known...".  Another wrote  in his diary of
Lieber, "The better I get acquainted with this man the  more do I admire him."
In the vestibule outside his classroom, Lieber  had painted the motto, "Patria
Cara, Carior Libertas, Veritas  Carissima," which epitomized the idealistic
nationalism of his thought.

​	Lieber detested the “political correctness” into which the College had
descended, but he resisted the temptation to indoctrinate his students
politically. Although he had very decided political opinions, he  carefully
avoided foisting them on his students after the fashion of  Cooper or Thornwell.
As he wrote, "I have imposed upon myself the duty  of using my influence with
the young neither one way or the other in  these discussions. I have
scrupulously and conscientiously adhered to it in all my teaching and
intercourse. There is not a man or youth that  can gainsay this."  A few
Trustees supported Lieber’s bid for the  presidency, but they were no match for
the opposition. Lieber's  opponents asked several of the senior professors to
allow themselves to  be nominated for the position, but these members of the
faculty politely declined on the ground that such behavior would be unseemly for
scholars and gentlemen.  Ultimately Thornwell persuaded the new  professor of
mathematics, Charles F. McCay, to accept the nomination.  McCay had only been on
the faculty for a year, and he was a mediocre  intellect, but he was a
Presbyterian with conventional political views,  so he became Thornwell's
candidate. Thornwell knew that McCay was  ill-suited to the task of
administering the College, but he hoped merely to deadlock the election and
force a compromise candidate upon the  Trustees.  Much to the chagrin of
Thornwell and his confidants, the  Trustees elected McCay, and the College was
saddled with a president  whose incompetence was as extensive as his eighteen
month tenure was  brief.

​	Lieber gave the Trustees notice of his resignation when  he heard of
McCay's election, and the faculty lost its greatest  intellect. Although Lieber
protested that his resignation was due to the fact that he believed McCay
incapable rather than to personal pique, he clearly took McCay's election as a
personal affront by the extremists  who dominated the Board of Trustees.
Privately Lieber fumed about the  grounds for his dismissal; "... the attack has
been made on your  unworthy friend for -what do you think? Keeping a mulatto
girl? That  would be a trifle! For having killed a person? Pshaw! we don't talk
of  bagatelles here. For high treason? Why, that might recommend me. No for
ABOLITIONISM ...."  Lieber left South Carolina College to take a  position at
Columbia College in New York City.

​	This arrangement  was applauded by many who shared the sentiments of
alumnus Whitfoord  Smith (’30), who wanted a "homogenous faculty" made up of
Southerners,  preferably alumni of the College. Such a faculty,

​	born and  educated among us, their principles, their sympathies, their
hopes, etc. would be identical with ours. As the politicians express it, "their
antecedents" would be known. A faculty composed of graduates of the  College,
versed in its traditions, understanding the temper and  character of our youth,
might well be expected to wield a powerful  influence over its students.... [A]
faculty composed of graduates of the College would find in their memories, in
associations perhaps of  College life, a common interest and affection which
bound them to their  alma mater, considerations of the strongest kind to make
them one  harmonious whole.

The Trustees shared the desire of many of South Carolina's influential men to
create an ideologically insulated,  politically safe faculty. The pedagogical
was the political, and only  Southerners of evident political orthodoxy could be
considered. Years  before the state seceded politically, the College had seceded
intellectually.

​	The consequence of the Trustees narrowness and  lack of intellectual
generosity was to impose on the College a president whose qualifications
consisted of the fact that he was not Francis  Lieber.  When he was ousted a
year and a half after being elected, as a  consequence of his maladroit handling
of gross misbehavior by the  students, one of McCay's many critics noted that he
"was not put in, so  much for an appreciation of his own merits, as from a
desire to keep out another individual of wide reputation and eminent
qualifications who  was distasteful to the board."  Prior to joining the faculty
of South  Carolina College, McCay had previously worked for an insurance firm
and  had been a professor for twenty years at the University of Georgia.

​	Off campus, McCay's abilities were viewed with contempt. One critic
caustically remarked that prior to becoming president of the College, he had
been "a professor at a Georgia college and a clerk in an insurance  office,
positions of equal dignity."  One alumnus wrote “The impression  on the mind of
the public at least is that McCay was elected through the influence of Dr.
Thornwell, and since his election things have gone on  at that institution, from
bad to worse, until everything like discipline is at an end…”.  The students
found the timorous McCay afraid of the  undergraduates' well deserved reputation
for turbulence. As one of them  wrote home, "if the president were only a little
less timid, we would be all right."  The undergraduates objected to his handling
of some minor  disciplinary matter, and he attempted to placate them by
wheedling and  coaxing in a way they considered deceptive.  They branded him a
dishonorable liar and eventually boycotted his classes.  One student  wrote at
the time that his class was likely to be entirely broken up.

​	Fortunately for the College, no students were expelled for their
boycott and McCay was removed in June of 1857. Unfortunately for the  College,
the replacement chosen by the Trustees, Augustus Longstreet,  was also appointed
more for political than academic reasons. Over the  course of a long career,
Longstreet had been a lawyer, judge, writer,  editor, minister, politician, as
well as the president of three Southern colleges.  While his background was
varied, he was no scholar, and his  difficulties were compounded by the fact
that he was sixty-seven years  old when he took the job. He had recently retired
as the president of  the University of Mississippi when he received the call to
South  Carolina College. Behind his back, the students, who found him
ludicrous, called him "Old Bullet."

​	One member of the class of  1860 remembered Longstreet as "a very common
man and unfit to teach  young men."  In the words of one faculty member, who
liked Longstreet  personally, he was "utterly unfit for the presidency of a
college. He  was not in any sense a cultured man, and could not inspire the
highest  respect of either the students or the faculty."  In contrast to McCay,
Longstreet was a vigorous disciplinarian who kept the unruly students in check.
He encouraged ultra-southern political opinions among the  students and he
himself was a secessionist.  As a result of his  propagandizing, he was popular
with leading political figures, but "Old  Bullet" was not of the same
intellectual caliber as Lieber or Thornwell.

​	The institutional matrix of South Carolina College molded two
generations of planters sons into a homogeneous political elite. The  College
inculcated a tradition of separatist political thought which  began in the 1820s
and was realized in practice in 1860. Honor was  uniquely important but breath
of intellectual life was not, and the  one-sidedness of South Carolinian higher
education had calamitous  results. Among the students still in the College when
Longstreet became  President, the impending war was wildly popular. In 1859 the
undergraduates had reorganized the cadet corps as an element of the  state
militia.   Secession and war offered the wild young men of the  College the
opportunity to achieve military glory and political  eminence. War was the
collective analog of the duel and prowess in  warfare conferred honor even
greater than prowess in dueling.  The  campus was frenzied with quixotic
anticipation of honor to be won as the time for action approached. The College
students, organized as a corps  of cadets, were anxious to enter the fray, and
as one alumnus recalled  the frenzy of emotion:

There could not have been any more esprit  d'corps manifested in any similar
organization. Drifted together from  all parts of the same state, inspired by a
common purpose, that of  education, being friends and classmates, and socially
upon an equality,  they had pride in themselves, in the College, and a fervent
love for the mother state, which burned brighter in the young hearts as the
threatened dangers to the state grew greater.

At that time they  affirmed that they would gladly accept the obligation of
"citizen  soldiers" in view of the fact that their state, their section, and
their "most cherished institution of African slavery" was threatened by
"fanaticism and aggression."

​	Charles Woodward Hutson (’60)  wrote a letter to his mother a month
before graduation informing her  that "we are all so excited about the state of
political affairs, that  many of us are making by no means diligent preparation
for the coming  examination. Our men - those of my class, I mean, are anxious to
be at  home, either to join companies already organized, or to aid in
organizing new ones."  Moreover, the students believed that their  exuberant
agitation in favor of calling of a Secession Convention helped bring it about.
The same student wrote his sister that

Great  numbers of speeches have been delivered here lately and as the students
made up always a large part of the audience, States-Rights doctrines  were
always enthusiastically cheered. The outside pressure, thus brought about, has
undoubtedly influenced refractory members of the  legislature, and the last news
from Charleston completed their  discomfiture. The consequence was the passage,
by a unanimous vote,  through both houses, of a bill calling the convention of
the state at an early date, elections for that body being appointed to take
place on  the Sixth Dec. When the convention meets we have every reason to
believe that the state will immediately quit the Union. I hope father will be a
member from Prince William's.... I am persuaded that war is  necessary...

​	The College graduation ceremony of December 3,  1860, was a joyous
occasion. A grand procession of students, new  graduates, military officers,
clergymen, alumni, state legislators,  professors, Trustees, the Governor, and
the president of the College,  all marched across campus in proud array. A
prestigious group of orators and statesmen, the apex of South Carolinian
society, had assembled in  Columbia to celebrate the gratifying achievements and
fine prospects of  the state's most polished young men. Thomas M. Logan, who was
ranked  first in his class, delivered an impressive Latin oration which was
widely commended and the other speakers distinguished themselves as  well.
Praise and congratulations were everywhere. The graduates received their
diplomas with the understanding that the future hopes of the  state rested on
them, and they eagerly anticipated their careers. As one member of this class,
Charles Woodward Hutson, remembered, "when the  seniors parted in that December
of 1860, it was with the firm conviction that they were about to engage in a
great cause and live in a great  time."

​	These exultant boys were doomed men. The triumphant  graduation march
was not the joyous ceremony that it appeared to be; it  was an ironic funeral
march for a culture that was about to die of  self-inflicted wounds. The
handshaking and congratulatory conversation  that continued throughout
commencement masked a hallucinatory optimism,  an unreasoning belief in their
collective invincibility. Such feelings,  understandable among undergraduates on
the day of their graduation,  were, among men a generation or two older,
grotesque, macabre, pathetic.

​	South Carolina's Secession Convention was to meet in Columbia in less
than two weeks, and many of those selected as delegates were the  graduates'
fathers, uncles or grandfathers. Dozens of the influential  men who attended
commencement simply stayed in town awaiting their  election to the Convention.
They spent a few days dining and drinking,  socializing and talking politics
until they got the opportunity to make  the single worst decision in all of
American history. The imprudent  temerity of those at the Secession Convention
cost them their lives,  their sons, and their world. Virtually all of the
College alumni who  could do so served the Confederacy. Those who survived the
agonies of  the Civil War were the maimed and miserable surveyors of a self
imposed  catastrophe. The third of December 1860, was a commencement day of
apocalyptic happiness.

​	During the “Secession Winter” of  1860-61, the early alumni of the
College were the elder statesmen of  South Carolina, and they were largely
secessionists. All of South  Carolina's governors between 1858 and 1865 were
alumni; indeed, they  were all Thomas Cooper’s students. Most importantly, South
Carolina's  Secession Convention was composed of a full forty-four percent
alumni.  The delegates could look across the room to see the intimate associates
of a lifetime; every member of the convention had classmates, friends or
relatives assembled, all connected by the solemn authority to schedule  their
collective destruction.

​	In April of 1861, when the  decision was made to bombard Fort Sumter,
the headstrong students could  not be kept on campus. "How could the gallant
young men of the South  Carolina College fail to be impressed with the patriotic
fever now  raging over the land?" asked the lieutenant of the cadet corps,
Iridell  Jones (’61).  Jones informed his mother that "There is no privilege on
earth, however great, that I would rather have than to go to war in so  holy a
cause with such a company. It is no more or less than a band of  brothers. The
very acme of my ambition is to go...."  Looking back on  the enthusiasm that
gripped him and his fellows about serving in the  Confederate army, Jones
accounted for their unanimity of sentiment by  pointing out

​	That a South Carolinian of the old school, who had  been taught by
proud, high toned, chivalric forefathers to guard with  jealous care his civil
and political rights ... should hurry to take  steps to withdraw his connections
from what he knew to be vital  encroachments by the General Government upon his
inherited belief in the sovereign rights of his State was not to be wondered at.

​	These  "South Carolinians of the old school" left en masse for
Charleston  without any authorization beyond the beliefs "inherited" from their
forefathers. Governor Pickens (’27) tried to dissuade the students from  going,
by telling them that the war would be of short duration, and that statesmen
would be more needed than soldiers, but the young men would  not listen.  These
impulsive young men served about three weeks, just  long enough to find out how
pleasant war could be. Years later Iridell  Jones (’61) remembered "our
principal duties consisted of drilling on  the beach and enjoying every moment
of our novel situation."  Since  there was no military emergency in Charleston
after the capture of the  fort, the students returned to College and resumed
their academic  pursuits, at least briefly. Everywhere they went they were
feted;  saluted by gentlemen, admired by the ladies, praised by politicians.
They were heroes, like the famous men they had read about in history.  And it
was all so easy. As Jones ruefully recalled, "They could not  raise the veil ...
and see in the near future the deadly, bloody,  disastrous and cruel war."

​	The students studied restlessly  during May and June of 1861 as armies
massed. They requested of  President Davis and a reluctant Governor Pickens
(’27) that they be  allowed to serve in Virginia. After much petitioning and
negotiation,  the Governor gave them permission to serve for three months, on
the  condition that they got the permission of the faculty and their parents,
and provided they agreed to return to the College in October.  Pleased  at the
prospect of such a splendid adventure during summer vacation,  they joined the
Confederate army. Few returned for classes in the fall.  Those who did only
remained on campus until November 8, when they  received news of the Union
capture of Port Royal.  The students sent a  letter to Gov. Pickens which stated
that they felt it "... derogatory to our sense of honor and of our duty to our
native state to remain  passive spectators...."  Pickens agreed. On the
afternoon of November 9, 1861, every student attending South Carolina College
joined the  Confederate army.  The state was at war, so the College was at war.
The  effect of the College on the alumni was directly acknowledged by more  than
one member of the secession convention. As Leroy Youmans (‘52)  remembered the
speech of secessionist Langdon Cheves (‘33)

More  than a quarter century after Cooper's retirement from the College,
Langdon Cheves [a member of the Secession convention]... so prominent in civic
and military life, late in 1860, when the question of secession  was
[considered] ...spoke not of his illustrious father, nor Calhoun,  nor Hayne,
but referred to and cited the words of Dr. Cooper as having  first given bent to
his thought which assured him of the soundness of  his political views...

​	Colleges propagate ideas. Ideas have consequences.
