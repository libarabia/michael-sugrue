DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD 1637 IN FRENCH

OPTICS, METEORS, ANALYTIC GEOMETRY

1 SKEPTICISM AS A METHOD OF CERTAINTY

2 RULES OF METHOD

1. ONLY ACCEPT CLEAR + DISTINCT IDEAS
2. MAXIMUM DIVISION OF PARTS (ANALYSIS)
3. SIMPLEST TO MOST COMPLEX
4. COMPLETE ENUMERATIONS

3 MORALS + MAXIMS WHILE CONDUCTING METHOD

MODERATION, NEVER QUESTION FAITH

GALILEO TO BE AVOIDED

HELIOCENTRISM CONDEMNED

4 PROOF OF SELF, GOD, REASON -> FINITE FALLIBLE IMPERFECT

JE PENSE DONC JE SUIS NON VACUOUS CONTRAST

I THINK THEREFORE I AM

D. -> GOD -> GUARANTEES REASON/MATH -> PHYSICS -> DREAMS

IMPERFECT MIND CANNOT INVENT A PERFECT GOD

5 SHEEP AS SOFT MACHINES

NO SOUL, JUST BODY

PROOF OF SOUL IS LOGOS, ABILITY TO FORM NEW SENTENCES

?HOW DO MIND/BODY CONNECT DUALISM

6 THREE YEARS AGO HE FINISHED THE WORLD BUT GALLILEOS FATE MADE HIM HOLD IT BACK

BEING + TARZAN TALK

DESCARTES HAS NOT FOUND THE FOUNDATION OF REALTIY

HE HAS FOUND THE FOUNDATIONS OF FRENCH

IN FRENCH, YOU CANNOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF

WITHOUT USING A “BEING” VERB

TARZAN COMMUNICATES JUST FINE WITHOUT “BEING”

“ME, TARZAN”
