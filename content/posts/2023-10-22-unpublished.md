Due to an unforeseen exposure to toxins. a group of sexually  reproducing organisms in a Petri dish suffered a population collapse  down to five or six thousand individuals. These survivors formed a few  hundred separate clumps. This population grew and slowly recovered over  roughly the next twenty-three hundred (plus) generations. At that point  this population had already increased to about four million individuals. Then, despite an occasional cooling trend, an upward trend in ambient  temperature coincided with an increase in rates of reproduction. Over  roughly the next four hundred generations reproduction accelerated and  the population rose from four million to approximately a two hundred  fifty million. After that marked increase, in a mere twenty generations, this explosively thriving population increased thirty-two fold to eight billion, covering the entire Petri dish. The Petri dish is the Carl  Sagan’s small blue marble, the organism is *homo sapiens*. In the last twenty generations we have adapted to every environmental  niche on earth, taken over the planet and made our first tentative steps toward getting off this rock and making the universe our petri dish.

increases to 8,000,000,000 in three phases:

Feral Phase ~ 2300 generations 71,500 BC- 3000 BC

Civilization ~ 200 generations 3000 BC -1500 AD

The Age of the West ~ 20 generations 1500 – Present

This remnant of feral human beings gradually prospered and they helped usher into extinction vulnerable megafauna everywhere they went, including  other species of *homo* such as the Denisovians and Neanderthal. Most importantly, they developed *symbolism* which extended the transfer of information and allowed for cooperation  on a massive and unprecedented scale. This accelerated their evolution  by causing evolution itself to evolve, moving from “hardware” to  “software”, enabling us to uniquely become the only animals that  domesticate *themselves*. The second phase began  about 3,000 BC with the emergence of the great river valley  civilizations, which is greatly advantageous for human flourishing. This is literally obvious, look at the graph. As Breugel said, “Ecce”. The  third phase, the rise of the West to global dominance in the last 500  years was the greatest achievement in history, and the greatest boon to  our species ever gave itself, with no serious competitor. In roughly  twenty generations, the globalization of peoples and languages and flora and fauna and ideas and techniques and communications and commerce and  war and invention and pioneering path creation during the age of Western expansion made the single greatest contribution to human flourishing  ever. Over 99% of the people alive today owe their very existence to it. Nothing has been more prima facie beneficial to our species than the  era of the Western hegemony over the last five centuries. Our dazzling  success as a species has allowed us to make the whole earth our home and to occupy every room. How did this happen?

*This* is world history.

Prologue On the Earth- Where Are We? Maps, Mercator Illusion, Creative Disorientation

The condition of not knowing where you are is called being lost. Our maps  of the world, the ideas within which we live our lives, are defective.  The vast majority of the world’s literate people, when asked what this  image is:

Mercator Map

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections

GET ALL THE RELEVANT MAPS HERE (SEE BELOW)

Will answer “the world”. Regrettably, *ceci ne pas une pipe*, it is a map, not the world, and like any map it necessarily contains  built in omissions and distortions. It was drawn up by Gerardus Mercator in 1579. It was useful to contemporary European mariners for purposes  of navigation and thus became a standard image. The particular  distortions of his map are greatest as it moves across latitudes from  the equator to the poles. The more northerly or southerly areas near the poles are drastically expanded compared to the equator and tropics.  However few mariners intended to go to the polar regions, so the  distortions didn’t matter much to them. The sailor’s pragmatism was  local, but Mercator’s problem with distortion was universal. It is an  unfortunate mathematical fact that there is no perfect way to represent  the surface of a sphere without distortion on a two-dimensional surface  like a page. Nor is there any perfect way to represent the human  condition.

One unintended consequence is that those  of us who have the advantage of education have sometimes imagined that  their mental maps are not distorted. This hybris is dangerous to you and the people around you. The smarter you are, the more you need to remind yourself that *every insight is partial blindness*. Look at the map above. Areas far from the equator are distorted in  terms of their distances and are shown much larger than they actually  are. This is one of the major issues with a projection of a sphere onto a cylinder. In fact, Greenland is nowhere near the size of Africa,  despite appearances; Alaska is smaller than Mexico, despite appearing to be triple the size; China is quadruple the size of Greenland, not  roughly equal. In the Mercator projection, Canada, the US, Greenland,  Iceland, Scandinavia, and Russia are inflated, as are Antarctica, New  Zealand, Australia, plus the areas around Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. Europe is inflated as well. The tropics, particularly Africa and  South Asia are relatively larger than they appear in the Mercator  projection. It is worth wondering if the regimes and policies that  emerged in the US and Russia been exacerbated by the fact that their  world map makes both of their territories look so much bigger than they  really are.

Mercator is not alone. The world might also be mapped like this:

And a different set of distortions would be implied.

Other accurate, differently distorted maps look like this:

And this world map centered on Chicago:

which could as easily be centered on Shanghai or Johannesburg or Buenos Aires or some coral flyspeck in Polynesia, all with dramatically different  results.

As long as the principles used in making a map and the  relevant unavoidable defects are acknowledged, they are all true, but  they are of varying kinds of utility, depending on what purpose the map  is to serve. There are different ways of mapping the same world,  apparently vastly different, because of markedly different choices among misrepresentations. No map of the world is undistorted, yet they are  indispensable, because without a map there is no way to know where you  are and where you wish to be. You can’t even properly get lost until you know where you are. Get used to the fuzziness of maps. It is the price  of clarity. Get over the distortions in maps, they are unavoidable. They make accuracy possible. Imperfection is inevitable but improvement is  possible. As Borges cleverly pointed out, maps must necessarily omit  some things so that other things can be presented. Everyone is inclined to put the thing that concerns them the most in the center of their  maps, thus the Chinese “Middle Kingdom” and the Roman capital city in  the center of the “Mediterranean Sea”. Epic poetry or epic history also  begins in the middle of things, temporally rather than spatially.

The shape of time is inevitably that of human life. Our stories and our  lives have plots. They are dynamic artifacts of memory integrating space and time and matter into us. Right on the cutting edge of temporality  where now happens we exercise will: transforming potentiality into  actuality. Yet our understanding of space and time is flawed. We know  they are infinite. Some impressive science says so. Yet we can have no  clue what “infinite” space or time means in any human sense. We know  space as local, bounded like us. Time is similarly constrained. Nobody  has ever experienced “infinite time” in any way that can be  communicated. Our time is a journey from a beginning to an end and  literature reflects this. Comedy is about revocable mistakes and first  half of life, which ends in marriage. Tragedy is about irrevocable  errors and the second half of human life, which ends in death. Epic is  our collective, common story through history. Joyce saw that our story  is about a finite past and an infinite future swinging like a hinge on  the immediately experienced present.

Like photographs, the value of maps is practical; their worth depends on  what you are trying to do with them. A satellite photo may fail to show  your dwelling, even at the highest resolution, but it may show the  location of a hurricane. Whether the photograph is a good photo or not  depends on whether you are selling real estate or forecasting weather.

No human representation, whether of space or time is perfect, is lacking  in distortion but there is more than what we get wrong. The best art  tells us lies that reveal the truth about who we are and where we are  and what our future could be. Maps are never as accurate in representing space as we might wish. It is the same with journeys through time, the collected sagas of our species are fractured reflections of who we  were, who we are, and who we might become. History on a global scale in the twenty-first century is the convergence of hundreds of centuries of stories lived by billions of people in vastly different circumstances  which might be mapped in an infinite number of different ways, for  different purposes, without any one map necessarily being either perfect or useless. This Big History is one of those stories composed of other  of stories intended to remind the reader that the Delphic Injunctions  are both good as ends in themselves and as a means in addressing the  Great Task: the reconciliation of love and reason. As is traditional, we begin, not at the beginning, but in medias res, with human beings of  our age symbolically mapping the historical world around them, pursuant  to knowing themselves and their circumstances.
