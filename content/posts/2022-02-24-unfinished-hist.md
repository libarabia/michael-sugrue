 ***Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going? -Gauguin***

**…all mankind is of one author, and is one volume… –John Donne**

**For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all  contrasting things -- oak, and maple, and pine wood; and pitch and hemp – yet all these ran into each other and in the one concrete hull, which  shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel;  even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man’s valor and that  man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into  oneness… --Herman Melville**

**The past, he thought,  is linked with the present by an unbroken chain of events flowing one  out of another. And it seemed to him that he had just seen both ends of  that chain; that when he touched one end the other quivered. –Anton  Chekhov**

**… anything he paints is both an homage and a critique, and everything he says a gloss.  --Robert Motherwell**
