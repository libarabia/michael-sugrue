Less Than Great Books of the Twentieth Century

​	Since it has come to my attention recently that there is some nebulous  impropriety in having a historian teach the great books in a humanities  class and further that a course in the history of ideas at AMU must,  inexplicably contrary to the practice at any major university, refrain  from assigning great books, it has occurred to me that I might obviate  such cavils by teaching a course on contemporary books that have not  been great.

I am thus tempted to offer a course on the worst books of the twentieth century, but it seems there were too many worthy  candidates for one course. Even after sequestering a group of grossly  overrated but not irredeemable books and authors (Galbraith, The  Affluent Society; anything by D.H. Lawrence or Virginia Woolf or H.G.  Wells or Jean Paul Sartre, for example) the number of influential,  highly touted volumes that imposed upon the reader malignant lies and or moral idiocy and or audacious stupidity and or apologias for evil and  or gratuitous cultural vandalism and or tendentious folly and or  destructive self deception, was simply too great to allow the inclusion  of all deserving volumes. 

I confess that I have a bias in favor  of what might be termed highbrow books, but I may be forced to include  some egregiously popular middlebrow books because of their extraordinary lack of intellectual merit and their conspicuous contribution to  dumbing down a culture that was not remarkable for its intellectual  virtues to begin with. For example, Tim LaHaye’s Left Behind series, the twentyfirst century apocalyptic wetdream of rural American folk  religion, is twelve volumes. This five thousand pages of prodigiously  tedious written material is middlebrow.  Sustained reading is required  to enjoy the release of resentment and anxiety that comes from this  endlessly tedious literary mutation; a hybrid between the book of  Jeremiah and Harlequin Romances. Lowbrow readers simply cannot read this much. There are no lowbrow books to consider in the 20th century as  they are now supplanted by videos.

​	I am left with a course  proposal that is uniquely constrained by all too limited time and nearly unlimited resources. Lamentably, I just do not have the room to include It Takes a Village or Pizza Tiger, or Are Men Necessary?  Moreover,  since God is merciful, I must gratefully concede that I have a finite  knowledge of the numerous truly wretched books published in the last  century, so I have surely omitted some very deserving works. I will  claim merely that the underwhelming books on this list are highly  influential and flamboyantly less than great.
