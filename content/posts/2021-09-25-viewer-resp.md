BEST YOUTUBE CRITICS ALL AGREE: This Marcus Aurelius Lecture Is an Untimely Act of PURE HETERO-GENIUS

"Pure moronic thinking"-Fernando Miramontes Forattini

“Biased and full of shit towards the end” - b pokhrel

“This is EXACTLY the kind of half-baked hand-me-down university talk that spawned the SJW movement... Deliberate mis-communication, deliberate falsification and twisting of words, cherry-picking cases and ILLOGICAL argumentation / ekstrapolations (sic)...” -Mando Palaise

“… misleading at best, and intellectually disingenuous to the point of academic malfeasance, at worse (sic).” – STAIR WAY

“Autistic tendencies in this young man…” -Michael Santucci

“He does not know many of the things he says, I for sure could do a much better job on this. He is not a stoic, he is a book reader an ordinary low class man not up the the standards that MA lived up to, a true noble being talked about by an ordinary man who can only look up the MA. But he does not know of that he speaks.” -Dhammarato Happy Skyper

WTF? Crazy Shit

“This Marcus Aurelius guy is a great speaker. Now I know why he's such a household name.” -Ben Taylor

“intelligence is to be held hand in hand with passion,(and thus at arms length) elsewise it is only a means to an ever prolonging end as to appropriate oneself in such a way that one might be found or recieved by the other once more smart and stupid are merely concepts we use in order to get to the point we need not hold on to rungs on the ladder of the like, it is ultimately all about the degree of passion one can be-hold, which is channeled by how aware and or for how long one can maintain that channel of awareness through which the unity of being may be freely transpermutated ad infinitum via the medium of experience(r/s) everything is much more easy, much more, not apparent per se but, summonable, perhaps, manifestible i suppose, and in so doing you see, just as temporary as all the possibilities are infinite, and so, eternal. only a finger pointing to the moon, it will not get you there, but may illuminate a way that is "closer"” -Brandon O'Neil

I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP-Musharraf Shaikh

To be rational is to be good is to be free of self-abuse... this is the circular logic of both self-aggrandizement and self-subjugation. Compassion is the irrationality that prevents moral virtue from being codified as ethical obligation. The rational delusion denies the voluntary subjugation of the self under legitimate authority, (be it intra-personal morality or interpersonal accountability). Stoicism seems to assume that: -individuals are, have been, and always will be as alone in relationship with others as they are in the universe; -that there is no true solidarity or good will among humankind; -that institutional and systemic biases are irrelevant, (or, at least, they should be); -that the promulgation of jingoistic propaganda, which distorts our common values, is not based on anti-social and ideologically fundamentalist corruption of civilization. These are the assumptions of a psychopathic society. –George Berven
