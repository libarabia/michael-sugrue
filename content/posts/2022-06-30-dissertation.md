**SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE AND THE ORIGINS OF SECESSION**

In 1856, one member of the South Carolina state legislature, whose  proposals for the reform of primary and secondary school education had  been thwarted by a voting bloc of alumni, stated bluntly:

The College--the S.C. College--governs the state. Its Trustees are the  Governor--the Judges--the Chancellors --the president of the Senate--the Speaker of the House--the Chairmen of certain Committees--distinguished and ex-distinguished personages of the land. Legislators talk of the  College with undisguised scorn for all other pretenders to the name of  College in the State, and most of those out of it.[[1\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn1)

South Carolina College was uniquely important in the politics of nineteenth  century South Carolina. The elite created by the College was implicated  in many of the anomalous characteristics of the states nineteenth  century political history, which James Banner once called the “Problem  of South Carolina”. Moreover, the influence of the College and its  alumni was felt throughout the lower South.

South Carolina  was the only state which never developed a two party system in the  antebellum period. Often only one candidate ran and was elected without  opposition. James Banner has noted that “In the 144 congressional races  in the state between 1824 and 1860, -78- or more than one half, offered  no contest to the voters. Moreover, 128 or 71 percent of the 180  candidates whose party affiliations are known during the same period  considered themselves Democrats. Of the rest, only 18, or 10 percent,  were Whigs”[[2\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn2) Current interpretations do not adequately account for the lack of an antebellum two party system.[[3\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn3) James Banner suggested that there was “…a link between these out of  phase party systems and the two great failures of American Federalism-  Nullification and secession- in which South Carolina played the central  role. The College and its alumni were intimately involved with all of  these crises. Many peculiar aspects of political development in South  Carolina before and after the Civil War were determined by the men,  ideas and political influence of the College. Part of the solution to  the “problem of South Carolina” is to be found in South Carolina  College.

​      During the antebellum period  South Carolina College also exerted a powerful influence on the newly  admitted states bordering the Gulf: Alabama, Mississippi, Florida,  Louisiana and Texas. At least one thousand, perhaps as many as fifteen  hundred alumni left the state, and nearly all went to the lower South.  In the process, these ministers, doctors, editors and lawyers  contributed to the development of a new political elite in these new  plantation societies. College alumni served as antebellum Governors of  Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. More than a dozen alumni were sent to Congress from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and  Texas. One of the forty-three signers of the original Confederate  constitution was a former president of the College. Eight of the  remaining forty-two signers were alumni.[[4\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn4)

​       Transplanted alumni maintained close ties to South Carolina even if  they migrated to the Gulf states. In 1833 James Dellett (’10) (later  Congressman Dellett) of Alabama opposed Nullification, but could not  bear to coerce South Carolina.[[5\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn5) He wrote “Although I am satisfied in my own mind that So Carolina is  wrong- yet I cannot forget that she nourished me in my infancy and  taught lessons that I learned in my youth and early manhood. I am proud  to say I love her in the midst of her faults…”[[6\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn6). Contemporaries commented, sometimes critically, upon the politicians of the South Carolinian diaspora and their connections to the radicalism  of their home state. In 1860 when Governor Madison Perry (’32) prepared  to lead Florida out of the Union, one writer described the Governor as  “a catspaw for South Carolina secessionists”.[[7\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn7) Alumni of the College represented four of the seven states that ratified the original Confederate Constitution.[[8\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn8)

​       More than three thousand young men attended the College prior to the  Civil War and it would be hard to overestimate the importance of the  College and its alumni on the political culture of nineteenth century  South Carolina. South Carolina College was a uniquely important  institution in political life and this was often recognized by  contemporaries. An early alumnus stated that "the great merit of South  Carolina College is that it tended to make the state one people."[[9\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn9)  One observer noted, "The South Carolina College has done more to make  us one homogeneous people than all other influences combined."[[10\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn10) The fact that the College was the single most important influence on  the politics of South Carolina's antebellum elite was well known. It was noted by a writer in the Charleston Mercury,

​       If the College goes [say] farewell to the unity of sentiment which has  made South Carolina, small as she is, the center and rallying point of  states' rights resistance; as Massachusetts has been, owing to the  influence of Harvard, of the antagonistic principles of encroaching  federal power. It is the educated intellect and the trained and  developed morale of the state which gives it tone, character and  direction.[[11\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn11)

​       The College produced ministers, doctors, editors and planters who  turned out to be indefatigable writers and talkers. Papers like the  Charleston Mercury and periodicals like the Southern Quarterly Review  allowed those alumni who dominated politics in South Carolina to reach a wide audience throughout the embryonic Southern Nation, a nation  conceived largely in their imaginations. Before the war, South Carolina  College was one of the most important institutional sources of ultra  Southern, proslavery, secessionist political thought. An alumnus stated  that "from its commencement, the College has become to a large extent  the center, not only of education, but of political thought in the  state, and is doubtless the institution which has done the most to mold  and influence the character of the people of the state."[[12\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn12)

​      The students of South Carolina College ranged in age from fourteen to

twenty, and they were drawn almost exclusively from the families of the planting

elite. These young men were given a hyperpoliticized education intended to create

gentleman politicians. The College was an organic institution of higher learning

which articulated and developed both an ethos and a political theory. The cult of

honor greatly influenced the temperament of the College alumni which was

manifested in their social and political behavior. The bluster and personal

touchiness noted in many alumni was manifested throughout their political careers

as well as in their political judgements. In 1860, of those members of South

Carolina’s planter elite who had a college education, more had attended the

College than all other institutions combined.[[13\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn13) Most importantly, South Carolina's

Secession Convention was composed of a full forty-four percent alumni.

South Carolina College helped keep alive a tradition of political discourse  which borrowed heavily from Federalism and the deferential “gentleman’s  politics” that it legitimized. Many themes stressed by South Carolina’s  Federalist elite, such as the pursuit of republican virtue by an  independent squirearchy, the support for virtual as opposed to actual  representation, the belief in natural aristocracy, the equation of  democracy with demagoguery, and the abhorrence of factions and parties,  were kept alive on campus and in the state house long after they became  extinct elsewhere. South Carolina's planter elite consciously restricted access to higher education the sons of the elite, and they educated  these planters’ sons in a locally developed political tradition which  was weighted toward quasi Federalist proslavery conservatism which was  gradually transformed into proslavery Southern nationalism.[[14\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn14) The College, which graduated its first class in 1808, was a locus of  atavistic politics from its inception until the fateful afternoon in  1861 when every student simultaneously joined the Confederate army. In  1857 the Charleston Mercuryacknowledged the conservatism of the College  when it asserted that "Our state Constitution ... but for the influence  of the College would long since have fallen before the attacks of  prejudice, demagogism and the spirit of shallow, narrow, socialistic  reform."[[15\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn15) Another newspaper noted that by educating the sons of the elite at the  College, the state successfully insulated the upcoming generation of  politicians from "foreign ideologies."[[16\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn16) Although in later years some tried to deny that the College was "the  hotbed of disunion and the political parent of those who were the great  leaders of anti-Union sentiment in the state," such denials were more  than a little disingenuous.[[17\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn17) From the 1820s on, a majority of the Trustees, faculty, alumni and  students were closely connected with proslavery secessionism.

​       The uniquely close connection between politics and higher education in  South Carolina was underscored by the fact that the College was located  in the state capital, Columbia, just down the street from the state  legislature. During the antebellum period, South Carolina College alumni were a dominant force in the legislature. If the alumni and their  relations voted together as a bloc, a majority could be found in most  legislative sessions, as some would be reformers found out to their  dismay. South Carolina College alumni dominated Federal officeholding as well: between 1830 and 1860, nearly half of South Carolina's  Congressmen and Senators were made up of alumni. In the absence of  organized political parties, the alumni were the most cohesive network  of influential political figures in the state. South Carolina College  was also crucial to the invention of the South as a self conscious  region with a distinct political, cultural, ideological and racial  identity. A complex of ideas, institutions, and men, all connected to  the College in some way, pervaded political life in nineteenth century  South Carolina and extended into new Southern states as they entered the union.

​      The alumni were a self-consciously  radical regional elite. After leaving South Carolina, most of those  educated at the College continued to entertain the extreme proslavery,  secessionist opinions inculcated there, although those who held elective office necessarily modified the expression of these views to suit their new circumstances. Dixon Lewis (’20) who served as a Congressman and  Senator from Alabama, mastered the idiom of Gulf state politics yet  maintained the same vocabulary and pan Southern assumptions as did the  nullifiers of South Carolina. During a Nullification meeting in  Columbia, a letter from Lewis (’20) was read with the following toast  “South Carolina- her course is the course of the whole South. Her defeat would prove a death blow to Southern Liberty”[[18\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn18) Apart from alumni of the College, such opinions were scarce outside of South Carolina.[[19\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn19) During the Nullification crisis, one of the few Congressman not elected from South Carolina who consistently supported the nullifiers was Lewis (‘20).[[20\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn20) He articulated the same militant vision of a South united in the  defense of slavery that the congressmen from South Carolina did.  Virtually alone among Congressmen not representing the Palmetto state,  Lewis predicted in 1832 a unified Southern struggle with the North:

…I will not even discuss this great question of Southern wrongs as an  Alabamian, but as a southern man, completely identified in feeling and  interest with that oppressed portion of the Union south of the Potomac…  Gentlemen on this floor believe that excitement, if not the opposition,  to this system in the South, is confined to South Carolina, and that it  has been produced by disaffected politicians. …Let gentlemen not deceive themselves into the belief that the other Southern states can or will  separate from South Carolina in the common struggle for their common  rights, whatever apparent differences there may be as to the manner in  which this struggle shall commence.[[21\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn21)

Lewis’ statement was not descriptive but performative. He was constructing a  Southern identity. A collective identity is an all too temporal  accumulation of such incantations.   In 1851, while travelling in  Alabama, Oscar Lieber ('49) wrote home to his father, a professor at the College, about the homogeneity of the political beliefs held by the  alumni he met as he traveled throughout the lower South:

Our College certainly holds the highest position among southern  institutions of the kind and most men who graduate are above the average intellect of the country...they spread over the whole broad acres of  the South and yet whenever you meet a graduate of our College, you can  be sure, yes 50 to 1 that he is strong in his political faith and that  that faith is of the right sort. It would be interesting if it could be  ascertained , for instance, what number of her alumni were Know  Nothings. I feel confident not more than 5% were of that party and not  more than 20% were indifferent. So regular is this similarity of opinion that a priori I should never hesitate to speak to them, but as if they  had already expressed it.[[22\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn22)

The political faith of transplanted alumni was predictable and homogeneous. It is noteworthy that alumni like Lieber (’49), armed with a diploma  and letters of introduction, had no problem finding other alumni who  might offer them hospitality, introductions to the local gentry, or  useful influence with other alumni politicians. The formidable influence of this “old boys network” extended throughout the Gulf states back to  South Carolina to Washington itself.

In their Secession  Convention of December, 1860, the elder statesmen of South Carolina  proclaimed the reasons for their decision in a “Declaration of the  Immediate Causes of Secession”. Of the seven men delegated to draft this document, one, Robert W. Barnwell was a former president of the  College, three of the other six, C.G. Memminger (‘19), F.H. Wardlaw  (‘18) and J.P. Richardson (‘19) were men who had met more than forty  years earlier at South Carolina College. The views in this document were endorsed by the Commissioner that had been sent to South Carolina’s  Convention by the state of Alabama, John A. Elmore (’24). He had  encouraged Cooperationists by informing the Convention on the first day  of its meeting that secession would “ give the cause strength not only  in Alabama, but with other states united with her in sentiment.”[[23\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn23) After seceding, the Convention prudently attempted to cement political  ties with other states. On December 24, one member of the Convention,  William S. Lyles (’32), made a motion to extend an invitation to sit at  the Convention to Madison S. Perry (’32), Governor of Florida.[[24\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn24) Lyles and Perry had been friends at College during the Nullification  Crisis. The next day Perry cabled back to the Convention that he  regretted not being able to attend immediately, though

I approve of every act of your Convention, in so far as it is known to  me, in every particular. Your Ordnance is in good taste, to the point,  and covers the whole ground. Permit me to assure you that gallant little Florida will be the next to follow your patriotic lead. Upon the  meeting of the Convention, Florida will, as certainly as anything in the future can be certain, wheel immediately into line behind the gallant  old Palmetto. We are identified with you in interest, in feeling, in  determination not to submit to Black republican rule, and a common  destiny must be ours.[[25\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn25)

At the Secession Convention, some men like Maxcy Gregg (‘35) wished to  include a list of peripheral issues like the tariff of Abominations and  the Bank in the Declaration, but fire-eater Lawrence Keitt (‘43) argued  forcefully for clarity, insisting that such trivial diversions  diminished their cause. He insisted that the focus be kept on slavery,  which was, as he put it, “the great central point from which we are  proceeding.”[[26\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn26) The Convention voted with Keitt. The document produced by the  Convention was perfectly candid about their reason for seceding. State  sovereignty is mentioned, but only with reference to slavery,

We affirm that these ends for which this government was instituted have  been defeated, and the Government itself has been destructive of them by the action of the nonslaveholding States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and  they have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the  States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted the open establishment  among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have  encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes;  and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and  pictures to servile insurrection.[[27\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn27)

The Declaration frankly acknowledged that the election of Abraham Lincoln prompted

them to secede because it signaled the triumph of abolitionism. *Their* Constitution

would not be safe in his hands:

For twenty five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of the common Government.  Observing the *forms* of the Constitution, a  sectional party has found in the Article establishing the Executive  Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A  geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States  north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high  office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes  are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that “Government  cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,” and that the public  mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate  extinction. [[28\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn28)

According to the Declaration, extending citizenship to black people only

exacerbated the lawless sectional partisanship and antislavery fanaticism which had

dishonored the North for a generation. The Declaration continued:

This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been  aided in some of the states by elevating to citizenship, persons, who,  by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and  their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the  South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.

On the 4th of  March next, this party will take possession of the Government. It has  announced that the South shall be excluded from the Common territory,  that the judicial tribunals shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United  States.

The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer  exist; the equal rights of the States will be lost. The slaveholding  States will no longer have the power of self-government, or  self-protection, and the Federal government will have become the enemy.

Sectional interest and animosity will deepen the irritation, and all hope of  remedy rendered vain, by the fact that public opinion at the North has  invested a great political error with the sanctions of more erroneous  religious belief.

​       This document, which the Commissioners of the new Republic of South  Carolina took with them when they invited other Southern states to join  them to form the Confederacy, contained familiar ideas that faculty and  alumni of South Carolina College had been advocating since  Nullification. The individuals who were appointed as Commissioners from  South Carolina and proclaimed its independence were equally familiar.  The convention had to choose its best and most capable men for such a  momentous task, and the choice fell largely upon alumni. On New Year's  day, Leonidas W. Spratt (’40) was elected Commissioner to Florida. On  January 2, 1861, A. P. Calhoun (’32) was elected Commissioner to  Alabama, John L. Manning (’37) was elected Commissioner to Louisiana, A. C. Spain (’41) was elected Commissioner to Arkansas, and former  Congressman M. L. Bonham (’34) was elected Commissioner to Mississippi,  but illness struck and he was replaced.[[30\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn30) C. G. Memminger (’19) was eventually appointed Commissioner to Virginia.

Each of these appointments was apt because these Commissioners had  previously established connections in the states that received them  which enhanced their credibility. John L. Manning (’37) was sent to  Louisiana, where he was well known as a planter with large land and  slaveholdings. Indeed, South Carolina’s Commissioners doubtless got a  warm reception from the transplanted alumni who graced the secession  conventions in Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,  Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.

​      On January 9, 1861, Mississippi was the second state to secede. The  Mississippi Secession Convention had five alumni among its members.  Henry Vaughan, Sr. (‘16) described himself as an "Old Line Whig  Secessionist." Hugh R. Miller (’33) was on campus during Cooper's  agitation over Nullification and he described himself as a "States  Rights Democrat." Andrew Pickens Hill (’41) came from a family of  Nullifying South Carolinian gentry who moved to Mississippi during the  "flush times." J. R.Chalmers (’51) a "States Rights Democrat" who had  been the valedictorian of his class, spoke in favor of secession.[[31\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn31) A few years later in 1864, Col. Chalmers became infamous as one of the  commanders in the massacre of surrendered black troops at Fort Pillow.

​      Leonidas Spratt (’40) was welcomed warmly by the Florida Secession Convention.[[32\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn32) Governor Perry (‘32), was an enthusiastic secessionist, as was the  President of the Convention, John C. McGeehee, (’21). McGeehee and the  other four alumni at the Convention voted for secession. The third state to leave the Union, Florida, seceded January 10, 1861. Andrew Pickens  Calhoun (’32) was well received by the Alabama Secession Convention. He  had been a planter in Marengo County for twenty years, had family ties  to influential "Southern rights" politicians in the state, and since he  was the late Senator's son, he was known to be a Calhounite.[[33\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn33) Important state officials, like the President of the Alabama Senate,  were alumni. In addition, five members of the Convention matriculated at the College during the 1830s and 40s. Alabama seceded on January 11,  1861.

​      Georgia seceded January 19th.  Louisiana seceded January 26th. Texas seceded February 1st. South  Carolina College alumni were among the members of all these Conventions. In later months, alumni were also members of the Arkansas and Virginia  and North Carolina Secession Conventions. For a small group of men, the  alumni of South Carolina College were astonishingly ubiquitous in the  creation of the Confederacy. The most dramatic index of the connection  between South Carolina College and the development of Southern  sectionalism is the activities of the graduates in the Civil War. The  College contributed many officers, including at least twenty-three  generals. Sixteen College alumni were members of the short-lived  Confederate Congress: they represented Georgia, Florida, Louisiana,  Mississippi, Texas, and of course, South Carolina.[[34\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn34)

​      The alumni had helped construct the collective identity of the antebellum South

and eventually of the Confederacy. Their influence was an important source of fireeating

radicalism in South Carolina and of the entire lower South, which many alumni took to

be a greater South Carolina. As one alumnus, who had served in the Confederate

army remembered:

To the College is very largely attributable the influence which has not  only made South Carolina the prompt and determined champion of Southern  rights and interests, especially state sovereignty, free trade, and the  institution of domestic African slavery, but which has also deeply  impressed the doctrines entertained, by South Carolina, on those  subjects on the heart and mind of the entire South and Southwest. So  great has been this influence as to give it historical significance.[[35\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftn35)

[[1\]](applewebdata://E3766755-8EFB-4058-A44F-8FFB89F0455C#_ftnref1)Thomas Moore (’62), a student at the College collected a scrapbook with  newspaper clippings of a controversy about the College and its political influence. These clippings were from 1856 dates of The Spartanburg  Express, (edited by T. Stobo Farrow (’52) and the Carolina Spartan,  which served as a vehicle for non-alumnus legislator J.
