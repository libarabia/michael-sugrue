God help me, some naif suggested that I should attach “trigger warnings” to my lectures.

As my daughter says about me when I lose my temper, “Release the Kraken”.

A fair number of SJWs need to be verbally eelslapped: See Eelslap.com

So here it is:

Pulling the Trigger Warnings for my lectures:

This lecture is unabashedly replete with xphobic, stupid, stigmatizing,  marginalizing, stress creating, upsetting, perverse, immoral,  disgusting, mistaken, unacceptable, reactionary, offensive, degrading,  traumatizing, revolutionary, inauthentic, hegemonic, dehumanizing, tone  deaf, alienating, dogwhistling verbal violence inappropriately delivered by an unfashionably candid speaker who is considerably less impressed  with you than you are with yourself. While the depth of his indifference to you and your exquisite sensitivities makes the Grand Canyon seem a  mere shotglass, all can be forgiven except for your fraudulent self  esteem, which demands an amount of make believe the speaker finds  onerous, bogus and boring. Not quite, but nearly as evil and cerebral as South Park (which its creators admit should be viewed by no one) these  lectures are probably not for you, as much due to your college rendering you unteachable as lack of native wit. This is not a problem for the  speaker because he has elected to refrain from desiring your approval  until he finds out what it’s worth and what it’s good for and why he  should bother obtaining it. Thank you for sharing.
